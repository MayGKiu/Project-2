    "- the biggest advantage of jupyter notebook for python coding is it allows cell-wise execution of codes. this is very helpful even at an expert coding level when we have large chunks of codes and they throw errors upon execution. breaking down code into smaller fragments not only helps in organization and readability but also eases error troubleshooting. generally from a good practice stand, it is better to organize and keep each cell performing one task\n",
    "- before we go down further into the actual codes, it is worth taking a closer look at how presentable jupyter notebook platform makes housing content, in general, not just code. double click into the first code cell and you will see that it is actually a *markdown* and allows including links, styling text, and so on. for the hashtags which are used to define headings, the more number of `#`, the smaller the text font gets. for `*`, single *italicizes* text within while double will make it **bold**. underscore also gives an alternate way to italicize text. another styling future is to add font colors to the markdown text by using `<span style=\"color:blue\">some blue text</span>`<span style=\"color:blue\">some blue text</span>, where the color can be changed to other colors too, try it out later and you can use that to add more life to your code notebook\n",
    "- I'm sure many or all of us have used Microsoft excel. the reason to bring up the good old excel is, for me personally in my coding journey, it has ALWAYS helped to draw reference to how I would execute something on Excel, then replicate that using code. Python can do EVERYTHING Excel allows and MUCH more right, so that is a super positive incentive to slowly upgrade and move towards Python programming"

    "- No capital letters! Except while naming a Python class (more on classes in a few weeks)\n",
    "- Variables should not begin with an underscore (this means something special)\n",
    "- Multi-word variables should be in `snake_case`. All lower case separated by underscores.\n",
    "- Technically, you _can_ name variables after built-in Python _functions_ (like `print`), but it's an _extremely_ bad idea to do so.\n",
